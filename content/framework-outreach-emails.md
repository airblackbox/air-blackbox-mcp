# Framework Maintainer Outreach Emails

## Email 1: LangChain Team

**To:** LangChain Integrations Team / Ecosystem  
**Subject:** structured logging and input validation — Community integration for EU AI Act compliance

---

Hi LangChain team,

We've built structured logging and input validation, a drop-in compliance callback handler that helps LangChain users audit their agents against EU AI Act technical requirements. It requires zero changes to existing code — just add a callback.

Would you be open to listing this in your ecosystem/integrations page?

**Links:**
- GitHub: github.com/airblackbox/structured logging and input validation
- PyPI: `pip install structured logging and input validation`

Happy to discuss how it fits into the ecosystem or answer any questions.

Best,  
Jason

## Email 2: CrewAI Team

**To:** CrewAI Team (João Moura)  
**Subject:** structured logging for CrewAI — Community plugin for multi-agent compliance

Hi João,

We've created structured logging for CrewAI, a hook-based compliance layer designed specifically for CrewAI crews. It integrates with your agent lifecycle to log decisions and gate actions for audit compliance.

Would you be interested in listing this as a community plugin on your site or in your ecosystem docs?

**Links:**
- GitHub: github.com/airblackbox/structured logging for CrewAI
- PyPI: `pip install structured logging for CrewAI`

Let me know if you'd like more details on how it works with crew architecture.

Best,  
Jason

Hi AutoGen team,

Hi Anthropic team,

We've developed structured logging for Anthropic, the first third-party compliance trust layer for the Claude Agent SDK. This demonstrates the ecosystem growing around Claude agents.

We'd love to discuss how this might be featured or contributed upstream. We're also happy to contribute improvements that benefit the broader SDK community.

Interested in connecting on this.

Best,
